<one-to-one> relationship using annotations :-
********************************************
=>To map <one-to-one> relationship make use of "@OneToOne" annotation.



refer onetoone diagram

sql script
Drop Table EMPLOYEE ;
Drop Table ADDRESS;
Create Table ADDRESS(ADDR_ID number(10) PRIMARY KEY, H_NO number(10),STREET varchar2(15),CITY varchar2(15),PIN_CODE number(6) );
Create Table EMPLOYEE(EMP_ID number(10) Primary Key,EMP_NAME varchar2(15), EMP_EMAIL varchar2(15),ADDR_FK_ID number(10) references ADDRESS(ADDR_ID),Constraint ADDR_FK_ID_UNIQUE UNIQUE ADDR_FK_ID) );

<many-to-many> Relationship :-
****************************
=>Oracle does not support <many-to-many> Relationship directly.

=> The combination of one-to-many and one-to-many can be act as a many-to-many relationship.

=>For Ex : 
	One Student contains many Courses.

	One Couse can belongs to many Students.

As a unit we can maintain <many-to-many> Relationship between "Student" and the "Course"
